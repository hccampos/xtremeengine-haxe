XtremeEngine
------------------------------

XtremeEngine is a simple, flexible and easily extensible game engine that I have been working on for some of my projects.

XtremeEngine has:

* A very extensible entity-component system.
* A scene management system with support for multiple cameras.
* A simple animation system that can animate properties of objects (e.g. rotation, position, etc).
* Integration with physics engines (currently I'm thinking of including a NAPE plugin out-of-the-box but Box2D shouldn't be hard to implement).
* Screen management and transition system.
* A simple library of useful math constants, functions and classes (e.g. 2D vector operations).


Notes
------------------------------
This a very early development version and shouldn't be used for any serious projects right now. As the engine matures I will be releasing new versions with more features and more API stability.
